#R2D2 an OPEN component collection for react.js.
 
React.js is a single page application framework ( from FACEBOOK ) which is in trending in a big way. Being only the 'V' of an MVC, react lacks components which we believe can ease up and speed up the development process.
One of the first thing we noticed when we were experimenting with react was routing capability.
 
R2D2 Router component:
One of the core aspects which it misses is the routing capability. So we thought of writing our own react router which can work on react version 0.13+.
Yes we have developed it with react version 0.13+ in mind and have not even tested it for versions before that.
 
The idea behind this development was to have an open framework where in people can understand the code and tweek it as per their project requirements.
 
Learning this component can segregated into 2 parts.

 1. The impatient ones: anybody who wants to experiment with it or use it.
 2. The contributers: anybody who wants to understand and contribute to it.
 
 
For the impatient Ones:


There are two patterns against which this has been tested.

1. Web Sites which does not require authentication
  [ please read Tutorial 1,2,3 ]
  
2. Web Sites which requires authentication to access the website

The requirement here is if the user tries to access a page which requires authntication then it should be redirected to an authentication page and then allowed to transition to the desired page.
